    "In this notebook tutotorial, we'll build on the map view of the wells we made in [Part 2](https://github.com/brendonhall/FORCE-2020-Lithology/blob/master/notebooks/02-Map-View.ipynb) and create an interactive dashboard using [Plotly's Dash framework](https://dash.plotly.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The really interesting part of this challenge is the fact that not all of the wells in the dataset have the same set of curves.  They all have gamma ray (GR), but otherwise each well has a subset of all possible curves.  When building models, it might be useful to be able to use subsets of the data that have the curves we want to train specific models.  Here, we'll build a tool that let's us select groups of wells based on which curves they contain, and also using the UI selection tools provided by Plotly. The tool will display the selected wells names in a list so they can be easily copy/pasted. This is a screenshot of the web app we'll build in this tutorial:\n",

Here we define a list of valid `curves`, and then apply a function `well_had_curve` that checks if all values of the curve for a specific well are `nan`.  It does this for each well and every curve.

    "Now let's use this dataframe to build a dashboard using the Dash Framework.  Dash let's you build interactive dashboard web apps using only Python - no html or css required.  If you already are using Plotly for viz then it's pretty straightforward to get started.  I'll discuss the components of the visualization below, but I encourage you to go through the [Dash tutorial docs](https://dash.plotly.com/installation) to for more insight in to how these components fit together.  It's well written and contains more than enough info to get started.\n",

Then we describe the layout of the app.  Dash provides Python objects that wrap the various `html` elements that comprise the web interface.  We're going to create a simple UI to start.  In addition to some titles and headings, we use a [multi-value dropdown](https://dash.plotly.com/dash-core-components/dropdown) to indicate which curves are required for the well selection.  We'll also use a [checklist](https://dash.plotly.com/dash-core-components/checklist) to indicate whether to include the testing and training data (or both).  A graph object will display the map.  Finally we include a code text section that will display a list of the names of the selected wells."
